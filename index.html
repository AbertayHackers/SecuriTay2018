          <p class="text-faded">Securi-Tay is an information Security conference held by the Ethical Hacking Society at Abertay University. After the sell-out success of Securi-Tay 2017, this year’s event will run on <b>Friday 2nd of March and Saturday 3rd of March</b>. The conference will be held in Abertay University, benefiting from the fantastic transport links to Dundee. As well as transport, Dundee benefits from affordable accommodation in the city centre, as well as a thriving technology community and the reputation for being Scotland’s sunniest city.</p>
          <p class="text-faded"> The conference is aimed at anyone with an interest in Hacking and Information Security. You don’t need to be a l33t h4x0r to attend and enjoy the event: Securi-Tay promises to provide a fantastic, worthwhile experience for everyone, new to the scene and conference veteran alike. The conference will feature talks from industry professionals and students as well as some workshops. Lunch and an evening buffet will be provided in the bar across the street. </p>

In addition, data egress and unauthorised access are difficult to spot without analysing every endpoint your business uses, including the ones normally outside your sphere of control. In this talk, we outline a new type of heuristics-driven internal security system, designed to be both developer-friendly and easily-extensible.</p>

                            <p class="abstract">Due to the increasing number of recommendations for people to use VPN’s for privacy reasons, more app developers are creating VPN apps and publishing them on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store. In this ’gold rush’, apps are being developed quickly and, in turn, not being developed with security fully in mind. This talk outlines some of the research undertaken as part of my final year dissertation into the security and privacy of VPN apps on Apple's iOS platform, gives an insight into the general state of security on an ecosystem that is generally known to be secure and discusses methods to build secure VPN clients.</p>

                            <p class="abstract">2016 saw a substantial rise in ransomware attacks and in some cases the return of some favourites with Cryptowall, CTB-LOCKER and TeslaCrypt being some of the most popular. The volume of attacks was in fact pretty steady for a good part of the year, with regular campaigns coming out on a weekly basis. It was interesting to see the variety in mechanisms used for the ransomware which not only included self-contained binaries but went all the way to the use of scripts. As part of the research I conduct last year, I wanted to understand why such a drive and lure for ransomware outside of the victims will pay as well as have some way of properly testing &quot;anti-ransomware&quot; solutions with an unknown variant. So to do that, I went ahead and built my own ransomware and drew some conclusions on why it became so popular.<br /><br /> The intent of this talk is to demonstrate why ransomware has become a tool of choice for attackers beyond the notion of victims will pay. By analysing and investigating existing ransomware and delivery methods, I outlined a framework to easily build my own version of a ransomware. </p>

New features include simple protocol analysis, side channel analysis capabilities, and significantly faster emulation. With these features FaceDancer lowers the barrier to entry for reverse engineering USB devices, allowing anyone to get a foot in the door when reverse engineering &quot;black box&quot; or access-limited systems.<br /><br /> This talk demonstrates how modern FaceDancer boards can be used to gather information and reverse engineer real hardware-- by performing direct protocol analysis, capturing side channel information, and leveraging emulation to characterize devices, all using only the opening provided by a USB port. This talk will feature a variety of live demonstrations, including use of FaceDancer to reverse engineer real devices.</p>

                            <p class="abstract">punk.sh is a just-released project that is the next generation of our former PunkSPIDER project. PunkSPIDER aimed to perform web application fuzzing using our custom, and open source, fuzzer/fuzzing library massweb. punk.sh is different in many many ways: first, it performs far more than just web fuzzing. It port scans and banner grabs along with web fuzzing and makes all of this information searchable via an intuitive front-end at https://punk.sh. The aim is to expose vulnerabilities that the bad guys are finding before they find them and alert sysadmins of these so they can then fix them. Oh and did we mention this is all completely free and that we're open sourcing all of the components?<br /><br /> We think punk.sh is a cool project, but its architecture is undeniably awesome. On the back-end we're using a scalable relational database to slice and dice the data how we (or you) want and a massively scalable queuing system powered by Apache Kafka. We're using nmap for port and banner grabs along with 100+ (safe) NSE scripts we run against the server along with web app scans from our custom-written web app scanner Ferret. This is all distributed across our queuing cluster, so various nmap and Ferret scans go off at once - don't worry though, politeness of the domains we scan is of the utmost importance and we don't allow our system to flood them with traffic.<br /><br /> In this talk we plan to go over the purpose of the project, its architecture, and generally how to use it to your advantage. We think it'll be fun!</p>

                            <p class="abstract">When security incidents happen, you often have to respond in a hurry to gather forensic data from the resources that were involved. You might need to grab a bunch of hard drives and physically visit the data centre to capture data from the systems. And that would mean getting dressed. When infrastructure is in the cloud, you have remote access and APIs for managing all your infrastructure, so you can respond to incidents with automation and do your forensic analysis in your bunny slippers. But is it as good as the capabilities you have in a data centre? Is getting dressed the price you have to pay for high quality forensics and incident response? In this talk Paco will explain the two major domains of cloud events (infrastructure domain and service domain) and describe the security and incident response techniques pioneered by AWS customers like Mozilla, Alfresco, and Netflix. He'll explain how to isolate resources to preserve the integrity of the data; get RAM dumps and disk image snapshots; and identify unauthorised changes to cloud resources using API tools and logs. And all of this while wearing pyjamas.</p>

Historical juxtaposition, detailed use cases and personal stories across two decades, 50 countries and six continents will help the audience better understand these threat actors.<br /><br /> Threat actors are motivated by financial, political and personal reasons. They act alone or in concert with others. Regardless, we hear all too often about attacks risking lives, destroying assets, threatening national security, and damaging businesses. In this presentation, we will explore profiles of each threat actor type to better understand the risks that each pose. By better understanding our enemies, our security can be more effective.<br /><br /> Presentation outline<br /><br /> This presentation will translate the &quot;who, how and why&quot; of cyberattacks. We will identify multiple &quot;old school&quot; and modern-day threat vectors and organize attacks by motives like sabotage and espionage. Each threat actor type will be explored in detail with real-life use cases and personal accountants. The examples used will illustrate the diversity in threats, methods, motivations, and organizational responses.</p>

In this talk I will reveal some exclusive research findings about what sort of careers the “next generation” are seeking, what the recruiters want from the applicants and understand what the barriers are on each side. I will also look at career paths into key positions in cybersecurity, and look at what the personality and experience requirements are for a successful application.</p>

                            <h4>Engineered Chaos: Vulnerability Anti-Pattern</h4>
                            <p class="abstract">There is a distinct communication gap between the software engineering and cybersecurity communities when it comes to addressing reoccurring security problems, known as vulnerabilities. Many vulnerabilities are caused by software errors that are created by software developers. Insecure software development practices are common due to a variety of factors, which include inefficiencies within existing knowledge transfer mechanisms based on vulnerability databases (VDBs), software developers perceiving security as an afterthought, and lack of consideration of security as part of the software development lifecycle (SDLC). The resulting communication gap also prevents developers and security experts from successfully sharing essential security knowledge. The cybersecurity community makes their expert knowledge available in forms including vulnerability databases such as CAPEC and CWE, and pattern catalogues such as Security Patterns, Attack Patterns, and Software Fault Patterns. However, these sources are not effective at providing software developers with an understanding of how malicious hackers can exploit vulnerabilities in the software systems they create. As developers are familiar with pattern-based approaches, this paper proposes the use of Vulnerability Anti-Patterns (VAP) to transfer usable vulnerability knowledge to developers, bridging the communication gap between security experts and software developers. The primary contribution of this paper is twofold: (1) it proposes a new pattern template – Vulnerability Anti-Pattern – that uses anti-patterns rather than patterns to capture and communicate knowledge of existing vulnerabilities, and (2) it proposes a catalogue of Vulnerability Anti-Patterns (VAP) based on the most commonly occurring vulnerabilities that software developers can use to learn how malicious hackers can exploit errors in software.</p>

                            <p class="abstract">Systems connected to the public internet can provide a large amount of information about themselves, and in bulk, the internet itself. By utilizing tools such as nmap, web crawlers, and reverse DNS, systems can be profiled and fingerprinted. This data can be used for anything from identify darkweb servers on the surface web, to identify system vulnerabilities, to honeypot discovery.<br />
The difficulty with deep scanning the entire IPv4 space, is it's size. Scanning even 10000 hosts per minute would take nearly 10 months to complete. Scanning the entire internet for a single port can be done quite quickly, but the proposed data set includes traceroutes, service detection, OS inference, web crawling, reverse DNS lookups, common vulnerability detection, IoT identification, and much more. All of which is quite slow to measure. Additionally, when scanning darkweb servers, this scan rate becomes even slower still.<br />
DeepScan was created to create, store, and use this data. DeepScan is a pipeline of both custom tools, as well as existing ones (such as nmap). It regularly identifies active hosts, performs a detailed nmap scan, and then collects further data on specific targets or services (such as crawling websites). All this data is stored, and can be easily viewed or searched in a web interface. DeepScan focuses on detail, accuracy, and speed for both the collection, and visualization of the results.
This talk will discuss the details of DeepScan development and structure, sample results, and future improvements.</p>

                            <h4>Vulnerability Anti-Pattern</h4>
                            <p class="abstract">Many technically-oriented degree programmes do an excellent job of providing students with a thorough grasp of technical and engineering skills and material, but fall short of providing the soft skills necessary to successfully deploy these in a professional or workplace environment. Yet these are the skills that will help the student not only advance swiftly in their field, but become a sought-after member of a project team. This talk will give a brief overview of the three essential soft skills that will help the student transitioning into the workplace be viewed as an individual rather than a resource, and ensure clients, customers and colleagues are treated as people rather than clueless bumblers, meme bros, or competitors:<br /><br />

i. Courtesy and respect - listening, valuing, retaining integrity.<br />
ii. Active listening and self awareness - considering before judging, paying attention and demonstrating, reflecting back, relevant questions, summarisation<br />
iii. Professionalism - responsibility, teamwork, “yes and” and “yes but”<br /><br />

It concludes with some thoughts on how these techniques can be pulled together in a way that reflects and enhances the best ‘you’ and the role of experience and continual development throughout the security professional’s career.</p>
